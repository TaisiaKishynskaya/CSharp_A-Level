        The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
        On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the Titanic, considered “unsinkable,” sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the deaths of 1,502 of the 2,224 passengers and crew.
